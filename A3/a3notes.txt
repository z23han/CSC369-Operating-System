a disk is 128 blocks, each of which is 1024 bytes. 
only 1 block group. 
32 inodes. 
should set the type (in i_mode), i_size, i_links_count, i_blocks(disk sectors), and the i_block array. 

blank lines don't matter (diff has an option for that), and 'used_dirs'

access to block group descriptor. find bitmap. bitmap is supposed to be after the group descriptor. 

we can know the block number of block_bitmap and inode_bitmap from my block_group_descriptor_table. 

major version < 1, the first non-reserved inode number is fixed at 11. And sb->i_rev_level, this means we are using ext v0.x.? 


block group = (inode - 1) / INODES_PER_GROUP

index = (inode - 1) % INODES_PER_GROUP

containinng block = (index * INODE_SIZE) / BLOCK_SIZE

INODE_SIZE = 128, 	if VERSION < 1
					or defined in the Superblock


each inode contains 12 direct pointers, 1 singly-indirect pointer, 1 doubly-indirect block pointer, and 1 triply-indirect pointer. 

it seems that the indirect pointers point to the data blocks. 

directories are inodes which contain some number of 'entries' as their contents. these entries are nothing more than name/inode pair. a directory stores these entries in a linkedlist fashion in its content blocks. 

How to read an inode ? 
- read the superblock to find the size of each block, # of blocks per group, # of inodes per group, and starting block of first group (BGDT). 
- determine which block group inode belongs to
- read BGD corresponding to the block group which contains the inode to be looked up. 
- from BGD, extract the location of block group's inode table
- determine the index of inode in the inode table
- index the inode table


blocks allocated sequentially when FS is new. 
inodes, blocks. 
seeks ??? 

cylinder group. 
superblock --- ... --- cylinder group ... --- 


in the block bitmap, or inode bitmap, each bit of 1 or 0 represents block/inode is being used or free. If we're given a block size of 1024 bytes, we would have a maximum number of blocks that the block bitmap can represent : 8 * 1024 = 8192. 


------------------------------------------------------
ext2_ls	arg1 arg2
	1st: the name of ext2 formatted virtual disk
	2nd: an absolute path on the ext2 formatted disk
	looks like ls -1
	it also prints out . and ..
	if directory doesnt exist, print out "No such file or directory"

ext2_cp arg1 arg2 arg3
	1st: the name of an ext2 formatted virtual disk
	2nd: the path to a file on native OS
	3rd: an absolute path on ext2 virtual disk
	looks like cp
	if file or target location doesn't exist, return error (ENOENT)

ext2_mkdir arg1 arg2
	1st: the name of an ext2 formatted virtual disk
	2nd: an absolute path on ext2 formatted disk
	looks like mkdir
	if component on the path to the location where final directory is to be created doesn't exist or if the directory already exists, return error (ENOENT or EEXIST)

ext2_ln arg1 arg2 arg3
	1st: the name of an ext2 formatted virtual disk
	2nd: absolute path on ext2 formatted disk
	3rd: absolute path on ext2 formatted disk
	looks like ln
	if the 1st location doesn't exist (ENOENT), if the 2nd location already exists (EEXIST), or if either location refers to a directory (EISDIR), then return error. 

ext2_rm arg1 arg2
	1st: the name of ext2 formatted virtual disk
	2nd: an absolute path to a file or link on that disk
	looks like rm
	if the file doesn't exist or if it is a diretory, should return error

i_blocks: 
	the first 12 entries in i_blocks directly reference data blocks
	entry 12 contains reference to a single indirect block (a block of block pointer)
	entry 13 contains a reference to a doubly indirect block (a block of pointer to singly indirect blocks)
	entry 14 contains a reference to a triply indirect block (a block of pointers to a doubly indirect blocks)
